1. Import the required libraries
2.   DATA PREPARATION
       Data Preprocessing
	    Create mappings
       MODEL INITIALIZATION
       Uniform initial probabilities
       Initialize transition and emission matrices
3. Define the model parameters
     (Normalize to probabilities)
     
     for an example (In this example, The state space is defined as a state which is a list of two possible weather conditions: "****Sunny****" and "****Rainy****". The observation space is defined as observations which is a list of two possible observations: "****Dry****" and "****Wet****". The number of hidden states and the number of observations are defined as constants. 

`   states = ["Sunny", "Rainy"] n_states = len(states) print('Number of hidden states :',n_states)  observations = ["Dry", "Wet"] n_observations = len(observations) print('Number of observations  :',n_observations)     `)

 then Visualize HMM Parameters

   4. Create an instance of the HMM model and Set the model parameters
For an Example = The HMM model is defined using the hmm.CategoricalHMM class from the hmmlearn library. An instance of the ****CategoricalHMM**** class is created with the number of hidden states set to ****n_hidden_states**** and the parameters of the model are set using the ****startprob_, transmat_,**** and ****emissionprob_**** attributes to the state probabilities, transition probabilities, and emission probabilities respectively.

`   model = hmm.CategoricalHMM(n_components=n_states) model.startprob_ = state_probability model.transmat_ = transition_probability model.emissionprob_ = emission_probability     `

   5. Define an observation sequence -- Example=
A sequence of observations is defined as a ****one-dimensional NumPy array.****

The observed data is defined as observations_sequence which is a sequence of integers, representing the corresponding observation in the observations list.
For an example - 
`   observations_sequence = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]).reshape(-1, 1) observations_sequence     `

6.  Decoding the observation sequence (Mainly viterbi decoder)

7.  Predict the most likely sequence of hidden states
The most likely sequence of hidden states is computed using the prediction method of the HMM model.
Example - 
`   # Predict the most likely sequence of hidden states hidden_states = model.predict(observations_sequence) print("Most likely hidden states:", hidden_states)     `
8. Compare with Naive Bayes (Baseline)
9.  EVALUATION METRICS(Accuracy, F1-score , Confusion matrix,Accuracy-Loss Curve , report Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared
Error (RMSE), )
10. Compare with Naive Bayes (Baseline)
11.  Plot the results
(Precision & Recall , historical data ,heat maps for spatial patterns , simple scatter plots to compare forecast vs. observation)
